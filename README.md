https://smartdust.me

Prepared and tested with Node version 20.9.0 and NPM 10.1.0

- Clone the repo and cd into the catalog you want.
- Run `npm i`.
- Read the contents of test.js. Pay attention to comments.
- Start a Remote Debugging session with a SmartDust Lab device.
- Run Appium and `node test.js` in that same catalog. (Maybe something else might also be needed as well, read the comments in test.js).
